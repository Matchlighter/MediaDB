A Django webapp for keeping track of Movies and the Mediums they are on.

A while ago, my family started moving all of our DVDs to indexed binders and we needed a way to keep track of where they were and what movies we own.
I decided to create this Django app for just that purpose. Over time, I have expanded and added more to it.

Although it is a functional solution, it has many unfinished and unolished features, so used it at your own peril.
